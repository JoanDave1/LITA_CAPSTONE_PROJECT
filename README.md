## Introduction
This report analyzes two datasets; Sales data and Customer data. The Sales data contains 50,000 records of sales transactions, including order ID, customer ID, product, region, order date, quantity ordered, unit price and total sales revenue. The Customer data contains information about 75,000+ customers and their subscription details for TV services, including customer ID, name, region, subscription type, subscription start and end dates, cancellation status and revenue generated.

## Objectives
The purposes of this analysis is to:
- Analyze total sales by product and determine the top performing products
- Determine totsl sales and quantities for each year
- Determine the top performing regions by revenue and quantity ordered
- Most popular subscription types

Using pivot tables and charts in Excel, SQL and Power BI, we aim to gain deeper understanding of the customer-sales dynamics and uncoveer insights that can inform business strategies to optimize revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Methodology
### Microsoft Excel: 
- *Data Source*: This dataset was provided by the facilitators of Ladies in Tech Africa(LITA) for Data Analysis class.
- *Data Cleaning*: I imported the dataset into Microsoft Excel. Althogh the data, after thorough examination, did not contain any duplicate or missing values, I made use of the "TRIM" functiomn to clean the data, and changed all values to the appropriate data types. I noticed however that the Sales Data did not contain any column for total sales revenue, so I created a new column for that. Using the "PRODUCT" function, I was able to calculate the total revenue for the entire column. The Customer Data did not contain any duplicate or null values. I only changed the revnue values to an accounting format to make it understandable.
- *Visualization*: I created pivot tables to aggregate, summarize and analyze the data and used charts and graphs to visualize key findings
